            <h1>Marks</h1>
            <p>Areas Mark: States within the US</p>
            <p> </p>
   
            <h1>Channels</h1>
            <p>Color</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Represents attribute of Color (Hue); Red and Blue.</li>
            </ul>
             <ul>
                <li>This is a good mapping because it very clearly distinguishes the respective political stance of each state.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Size</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Represents attribute of type Size (Area).</li>
            </ul>
             <ul>
                <li>This is a bad mapping because the physical Size of each state does not affect the number of electoral votes.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h1>Colormap(s)</h1>
            <p>Colormap: What 2016 would look like if just women voted</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Represents attribute of type Divergent Colormaps.</li>
                <li>This is a good mapping because the two colors represent extremes of a range of political stances.</li>
            </ul>

            <h1>Marks</h1>
            <p>Points Mark: Balls (Points) on Graph</p>   
            <h1>Channels</h1>
            <p>Color</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Represents attribute of Color (Saturation): the points exist on a pink to orange spectrum.</li>
            </ul>
            <ul>
                <li>This is a good mapping because it very clearly distinguishes the range of scoring values through the color saturation attribute.</li>
            </ul>
            </ul>
            <p>Position</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Represents attribute of Position (Horizontal and Vertical): the points exist can range from left to right as well as up and down.</li>
            </ul>
            <ul>
                <li>This is a good mapping because it visualizes the optimal metric for two variables: launch angle and exit velocity. This provides for a more insightful visualization.</li>
            </ul>
            <h1>Colormap(s)</h1>
            <p>Colormap: Scoring value (LWTS) of batted balls based on launch angle and speed off the bat, 2015 MLB</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Represents attribute of type Sequential Colormaps.</li>
            </ul>
             <ul>
                <li>This is a good mapping because the sequential color scheme indicates difference in the amount of phenomenon which is relevant to the corresponding scoring value that exists on a spectrum.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h1>Marks</h1>
            <p>Points Mark: Prices (Points) on Graph</p>
            <p>Areas Mark: Averages (Boxes)</p>
   
            <h1>Channels</h1>
            <p>Color</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Represents attribute of Color (Hue): individual and independent colors.</li>
            </ul>
             <ul>
                <li>This is a good mapping because it clearly seperates each category into its own color. The Hue (color) was the right selection because there is not relationship between the brands.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Position</p>
        <ul>
                <li>Represents attribute of Position (Vertical): the points can move up and down.</li>
            </ul>
             <ul>
                <li>This is a good mapping because it is a very intuitive concept that as the price increases, the points will be plotted higher on the y-axis.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h1>Colormap(s)</h1>
            <p>Colormap: Price Distribution of Popular Smart Device Brands</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Represents atrtibute of type Categorical Colormaps.</li>
            </ul>
                <li>This is a good mapping because the visualization is split into categories with distinct colors. A categorical colormap was the right choice for this graph.</li>
             <ul>
            </ul>
